        "1. **Grid Search**: Tries all possible combinations of the hyperparameters provided in `param_grid`. It's exhaustive but can be time-consuming for large grids.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Random Search**: Randomly samples combinations of hyperparameters from the distributions provided in `param_dist`. It's faster than grid search, especially when the search space is large.\n",

        "### **Results**:\n",
