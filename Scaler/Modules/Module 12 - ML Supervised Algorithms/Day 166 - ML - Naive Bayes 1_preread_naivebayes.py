## Conditional Probability

#### Q. What is meant by conditional probability of two events?
 The probability of occurrence of any event A when another event B in relation to A has already occurred is known as conditional probability. It is depicted by P(A|B).

 #### Q. How do we calculate conditional probability?
- The conditional probability of the two events A and B $P(A|B)$ is the ratio of the probability of intersection of the two events $P(A \cap B)$ and the probability of the conditioned event $P(B)$
 - $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} $

#### Q. How can we simplify the conditional probability value?
- Consider $P(A \cap B)$ term
 - Let N represent the total number of elements in the sample space.
 - Let N(A ∩ B) be the number of elements common to both A and B.
 - We know that $P(A \cap B) = \frac{N(A \cap B)}{N}$

- Consider $P(B)$ term
 - Let N(B) be the number of elements in B, and it cannot be equal to zero.
 - Hence, we can say that $P(B) = \frac{N(B)}{N}$ and $P(B) \neq 0$

- Plugging in the values, we get,
 $P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{N(A \cap B)}{N}}{\frac{N(B)}{N}} = \frac{N(A \cap B)}{N(B)}$

#### Q. Why do we need conditional probability?
Conditional probability is required when some events may occur in relation to the occurrence of another event.

#### Q. What does given mean in probability?
While writing the conditional probability of A given B, i.e. P(A|B), the symbol “|” represent the word “given”. This means the event after “|” is already occurred.

#### Let's understand with an example
**Problem Statement:** Two dies are thrown simultaneously, and the sum of the numbers obtained is found to be 7. What is the probability that the number 3 has appeared at least once?

**Solution:** The sample space S would consist of all the numbers possible by the combination of two dies. Therefore S consists of 6 × 6, i.e. 36 events.

Event A indicates the combination in which 3 has appeared at least once.

Event B indicates the combination of the numbers which sum up to 7.

A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)(3, 4)(3, 5)(3, 6)(1, 3)(2, 3)(4, 3)(5, 3)(6, 3)}

B = {(1, 6)(2, 5)(3, 4)(4, 3)(5, 2)(6, 1)}

$P(A) = \frac{11}{36}$

$P(B) = \frac{6}{36}$

$N(A ∩ B) = 2$

$P(A ∩ B) = \frac{2}{36}$

Applying the conditional probability formula we get,

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A∩B)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{6}{36}} = \frac{1}{3}$

The probability that the number 3 has appeared at least once is 0.33

## Baye's Theorm

#### Q. What is Bayes Theorem?
Bayes theorem, in simple words, determines the conditional probability of an event A given that event B has already occurred.

#### Q. What is the Bayes Theorm formulation?
- If A and B are two events, we know that the probability of A given B is the ratio of the probability of their intersection and the probability of B, i.e., <br>
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A∩B)}{P(B)}, P(B) ≠ 0$

- Similarly, the probability of B given A is the ratio of the probability of their
intersection and the probability of A, i.e., <br>
$P(B|A) = P(B∩A) / P(A)$

- Now, as P(A∩B) = P(B∩A), from the above two equations, we get <br>
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}, P(B) ≠ 0$

#### Q. What are some properties of Bayes theorm?
- **Property 1:** Let E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have: $P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1$

- **Property 2:** If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event of S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then;
$P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A ∩ B)|F)$

- **Property 3:** P(A′|B) = 1 − P(A|B)

#### Let's understand with an example.
**Problem Statement:** A man is known to speak the truth 2 out of 3 times. He throws a die and reports that the number obtained is a four.

Find the probability that the number obtained is actually a four.

<br>

**Solution:**

Let $A$ be the event that the man reports that number four is obtained.

Let $E1$ be the event that four is obtained and $E2$ be its complementary event.

Then, $P(E1)$ = Probability that four occurs = $\frac{1}{6}$

$P(E2)$ = Probability that four does not occur = $1- P(E1) = 1 – \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$

Also, $P(A|E1)$= Probability that man reports four and it is actually a four = $\frac{2}{3}$

$P(A|E2)$ = Probability that man reports four and it is not a four = $\frac{1}{3}$

By using Bayes’ theorem, probability that number obtained is actually a four,

$P(E1|A) = \frac{P(E1) P(A|E1)}{P(E1) P(A|E1) + P(E2) P(A|E2)} = \frac{\frac{1}{6} \frac{2}{3}}{\frac{1}{6} \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{6} \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{2}{7}$
