# **Q1. Match Digit Sequence**

Which regex pattern in Python can be used to match any sequence of digits?

#### **Ans:** \d+

# **Q2. Words starting with A or B**

How can you extract all the words that start with the letter 'A' or 'B' from a given string using regex in Python?


```
A. \b[A-B]\w+\b

B. \b[A|B]\w+\b

C.  ^[AB]\w+$

D.  \b[A,B]\w+\b
```

#### **Ans:**

Option A: \b[A-B]\w+\b

# **Q3. Construct regex**

Which of the following regex pattern can be used to validate a strong password in Python.

A strong password must meet the following criteria:

* At least 8 characters long
* Contains at least
  * one uppercase letter
  * one lowercase letter
  * one digit
  * and one special character from the set: !@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:'",.<>?/

```
A. ^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()-_=+[\]{}|;:'",.<>?/]).{8,}$

B. ^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[\W_]).{8,}$

C. ^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()-_=+[\]{}|;:'",.<>?/]).$

D. ^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[^a-zA-Z\d]).{8,}$
```

#### **Ans:**

```
Option A: ^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()-_=+[\]{}|;:'",.<>?/]).{8,}$
```

# **Q4. Regex result**

Given the following regex pattern `x = '(\d+)\s(?:apples|mangoes)'`, what will be the result of `re.findall(x, '7 apples and 4 mangoes')`?

#### **Ans:**

['7', '4']
"""

import re

pattern = r"(\d+)\s(?:apples|mangoes)"
print(re.findall(pattern, '7 apples and 4 mangoes'))

"""# **Q5. Match Hello**

How can you check if a string starts with the prefix "hello" using regex in Python?

#### **Ans:**

^hello.*$

# **AQ1. Extract Valid Emails**

**Problem Description**

You are given a list of email addresses, some of which are valid and some are invalid. Your task is to write a function validate_emails(emails) that takes a list of email addresses as input and returns a list containing only the valid email addresses.

A valid email address should adhere to the following rules:

* It must contain exactly one "@" symbol.
* It must contain at least one character before the "@" symbol.
* It must contain at least one character after the "@" symbol.
* It must end with a valid domain extension such as ".com", ".org", ".net", ".edu", or ".gov".
* The local part (characters before the "@") can only contain alphanumeric characters, dots ".", underscores "_", or hyphens "-".
* Characters after the "@", cannot contain any special character except dots ".", alphabets or numbers.

Your function should use regular expressions to validate each email address and return only the valid ones.
