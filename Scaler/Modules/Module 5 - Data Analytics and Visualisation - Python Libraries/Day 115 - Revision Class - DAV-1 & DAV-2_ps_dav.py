Question 1: What will be the output of the following NumPy code?


import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60], [70, 80, 90]])
print(arr[1:, 1:])

A) [[50, 60], [80, 90]]
B) [[40, 50], [70, 80]]
C) [[50, 60]]
D) [[20, 30], [50, 60], [80, 90]]

Question 2: You are given a sales dataset (3x3 matrix). Perform the following operations:

Find if any region had sales below 50 (np.any()).
Check if all regions had sales above 20 (np.all()).
Mark sales greater than 100 as "High", otherwise "Low" (np.where()).

sales = np.array([[120, 80, 30],
              [45, 60, 150],
              [10, 110, 90]])

import numpy as np

A = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
B = A.view()
print(A)
print(B)
B[1] = 99

# print(A)
print(B)
print(A)

What will be the output?
A)
[1 2 3 4]
[1 99 3 4]

B)
[1 99 3 4]
[1 99 3 4]

C)
[1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]

D) Error

import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

C = np.hstack((A, B))
D = np.vstack((A, B))

print(C.shape, D.shape)

A) (2, 4), (4, 2)
B) (4, 2), (2, 4)
C) (2, 2), (2, 2)
D) Error

Question 8: You are given a DataFrame df containing sales data. It has duplicate
records, and you need to remove them while keeping only the first occurrence.
Then, you sort the DataFrame by the 'Revenue' column in descending order.

Which of the following Pandas operations will achieve this?



C) df.drop_duplicates(keep='first').sort_values('Revenue', ascending=True)
D) df.drop_duplicates(keep='first').sort_values('Revenue', ascending=False)

You have a DataFrame containing sales transactions. You want to group by "Region"
and compute the standard deviation of sales.
However, you also need a custom transformation where each value
is scaled based on the group's max sale.

Which of the following correctly implements both?

A)df.groupby("Region")["Sales"].std().apply(lambda x: x / x.max())
B)df.groupby("Region")["Sales"].transform(lambda x: x / x.max())
C)df.groupby("Region").apply(lambda x: x["Sales"].std() / x["Sales"].max())
D)df.groupby("Region")["Sales"].agg(["std", lambda x: x / x.max()])





import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    "Region": ["East", "East", "West", "West", "South", "South"],
    "Sales":  [100, 200, 150, 300, 400, 500]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.head()

df.groupby("Region")["Sales"].std()

df.groupby("Region")["Sales"].transform(lambda x: x / x.max())

df.groupby("Region").apply(lambda x: x["Sales"].std() / x["Sales"].max())

A bank is analyzing customer loan defaults across different years and regions. You need to:

Create a pivot table showing average default rate per region & year.
Melt the pivot table to long format.
Bin default rates into categories:
Low (< 5%)
Medium (5% - 10%)
High (> 10%)

df = pd.DataFrame({
"Year": [2021, 2021, 2022, 2022, 2023, 2023],
"Region": ["East", "West", "East", "West", "East", "West"],
"Default_Rate": [4.5, 8.0, 12.5, 6.0, 3.0, 15.0]
})

You have a DataFrame with missing values:


df = pd.DataFrame({
"Product": ["Laptop", "Tablet", "Phone", None],
"Price": [1000, np.nan, 500, 800]})

Which of the following correctly fills missing product names with "Unknown"
and fills missing prices with the column's median?

A)df = df.fillna({"Product": "Unknown", "Price": df["Price"].mean()})

B)df = df.fillna({"Product": "Unknown", "Price": df["Price"].median()})

C)df = df["Product"].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
df["Price"].fillna(df["Price"].median(), inplace=True)

D)df = df.replace(np.nan, {"Product": "Unknown", "Price": df["Price"].median()})

Assuming all outcomes are equally likely, what is the probability of A ∪ B?

Sample space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Options:
a) 3/6
b) 4/6
