# Creating a DataFrame from Scratch

---

In this notebook, we'll explore some common methods to construct a dataframe from scratch.

For clarity we'll convert this data into different data structures and then create dataframes out of them.
"""

| Name      | Age  | Department  |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Alice     | 25   | Marketing   |
| Bob       | 32   | Engineering |
| Charlie   | 28   | Sales       |
| Denise    | 35   | Finance     |

"""### Method 1: List

We can create a list of lists, where
- each nested list holds the data of row in the required order
- and another list to hold the name of columns.
"""

import pandas as pd

data = [
    ['Alice', 25, 'Marketing'],
    ['Bob', 32, 'Engineering'],
    ['Charlie', 28, 'Sales'],
    ['Denise', 35, 'Finance']
]

column_names = ['Name', 'Age', 'Department']

"""Now we can use the `DataFrame` class of Pandas to generate the dataframe out of these lists."""

df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=column_names)
df

"""### Method 2: Dictionary

For this we can store the data column-wise, where
- each key represent the name of column and
- corresponding values is a list holds the data of that column.
"""

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Denise'],
    'Age': [25, 32, 28, 35],
    'Department': ['Marketing', 'Engineering', 'Sales', 'Finance']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df

"""### Method 3: Series in Pandas

Here we create a series of each column individually and then pass them within `pd.DataFrame` as a values to dictionary.
"""

name_series = pd.Series(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Denise'])
age_series = pd.Series([25, 32, 28, 35])
department_series = pd.Series(['Marketing', 'Engineering', 'Sales', 'Finance'])

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': name_series,
    'Age': age_series,
    'Department': department_series
})
df

"""### Method 4: Numpy Arrays

This is very similar to the nested lists method.
"""

data = np.array([
    ['Alice', 25, 'Marketing'],
    ['Bob', 32, 'Engineering'],
    ['Charlie', 28, 'Sales'],
    ['Denise', 35, 'Finance']
])

### General methods for reading files -

We can create dataframe from the files containing data in different formats like csv, excel sheets, json, etc.

### From CSV file

This is how our data looks in a csv file:

```
Name,Age,Department
Alice,25,Marketing
Bob,32,Engineering
Charlie,28,Sales
Denise,35,Finance
```

We can read through this and directly pass the path of corresponding csv file to `pd.read_csv` method as follows.

# # creating .csv file with data
# %%writefile data.csv
# 
# Name,Age,Department
# Alice,25,Marketing
# Bob,32,Engineering
# Charlie,28,Sales
# Denise,35,Finance

pd.read_csv("data.csv")

"""### From JSON file

Here is our original data in json format:

```json
{'Name': {'0': 'Alice', '1': 'Bob', '2': 'Charlie', '3': 'Denise'},
 'Age': {'0': '25', '1': '32', '2': '28', '3': '35'},
 'Department': {'0': 'Marketing',
  '1': 'Engineering',
  '2': 'Sales',
  '3': 'Finance'}}
```

We can directly store this in a .json file and read it from that using the `pd.read_json` method.
