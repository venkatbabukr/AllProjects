# **Q1. Applications of the Supervised Learning**

Select the problem statements where you can apply supervised algorithms.

**Options:**

1. For an e-commerce website, segmenting the unlabelled customers based on their behaviour from a large dataset.
2. Given data on crop yields over the last 50 years, trying to predict next year's crop yields.
3. Based on data samples of webpages, classifying a webpage whether the content on the web page should be considered "child friendly" or "adult".
4. Given a large dataset of medical records from patients suffering from heart disease, try to learn whether there might be different groups of such patients.

#### **Ans:**

Options 2 & 3:

* Given data on crop yields over the last 50 years, trying to predict next year's crop yields.
* Based on data samples of webpages, classifying a webpage whether the content on the web page should be considered "child friendly" or "adult".

Because in 1 & 4 - we are trying to do clustering and there is **no explicit targets** available!

# **Q2. Applications of Unsupervised learning**

What are the applications of Unsupervised learning ?

**Options:**

1. Grouping of images of different types of animals, based on the image features only
2. Given the dataset with previous 5 years of the prices of the houses. Predicting the house price.
3. Grouping together users with similar viewing patterns in order to recommend similar content.
4. Predicting the class of fruit given we know the type of fruits.

#### **Ans:**

Options 1 & 3:

* Grouping of images of different types of animals, based on the image features only
* Grouping together users with similar viewing patterns in order to recommend similar content.

Again here, in 1 & 3 - no targets are given, while in 2 & 4 we know the targets.

# **Q3. Person of Interest**

Popular online shopping platforms like Myntra, Flipkart, and Amazon are trying to group their clients based on their recent purchases and interests so that they can design a suitable marketing strategy.

Which of the following Machine Learning method will be appropriate for doing so?

#### **Ans:**

Clustering!

# **Q4. Price is right**

A firm is making a shopping mall and they have hired you as a Data Scientist for evaluating the prices of shops.

Which of the following Machine Learning task will you use?

#### **Ans:**

Regression

# **Q5. Mr. Robot ?**

You are an analyst at SBI Bank and recently discovered customer accounts to be hacked.

So you want to create software that categorizes each customer's account as hacked or safe.

Which machine learning task will be helpful in this particular task?

#### **Ans:**

Classification

# **Q6. Poseidon**

Government agencies that predict tsunamis, use Tsunami-detection buoys to confirm the existence of underwater earthquakes.

These buoys use the height of the waves and change in water pressure to predict a Tsunami.

Which of the following method might be used for doing the mentioned task?

#### **Ans:**

Classification

# **Q7. Cells at work**

While conducting a Bone-marrow transplant, doctors check whether the donor's cells are healthy or not. Several organizations use Machine learning models to determine healthy cells.

Which of the following machine learning methods can be used?

#### **Ans:**

Classification

# **AQ1. ML Paradigm**

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Suppose we want to predict the future prices of cryptocurrency based on some data. According to the definition given above, What would be a reasonable choice for P?

**Options**:

1. The Price prediction task.
2. Based on the learning over past data, the process of learning to find the patterns within newer data.
3. The accuracy of the algorithm for correctly predicting the future price of crypto-currencies.
4. None of these.

#### **Ans:**

Option 3: The accuracy of the algorithm for correctly predicting the future price of crypto-currencies.

# **AQ2. Unlabelled**

What type of machine learning algorithm is suitable for unlabeled data?

#### **Ans:**

Clustering (Unsupervised learning)

# **AQ3. Penny for suggestion?**

What procedure or method powers Spotify's suggestion for a new song?

**Options:**

1. Recommendation System
2. Classification
3. Regression
4. None of the above

#### **Ans:**

Option 1. Recommendation System

# **AQ4. Fly away**

Imagine you are working in Vistara. You are given a task of **predicting the airline fare** based on previous trends.

What kind of machine learning task would this be categorized into?

#### **Ans:**

Time series forcasting
