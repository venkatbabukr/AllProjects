Before diving into today's Lecture,

lets revise a couple of

#### Simple Derivation rules

Which will be important for today's Lecture

1. **Power Derivative**

 $$\frac{d x^{n}}{dx} = n.x^{n-1}$$

 Similarly

  $$\frac{d x^{-n}}{dx} = -n.x^{-(n+1)}$$

2. **Log Derivative**

$$\frac{d log(x)}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}$$

3. **Exponential Derivative**

 $$\frac{d e^{ax}}{dx} = a.e^{ax}$$

 Similarly,

 $$\frac{d e^{-ax}}{dx} = -a.e^{-ax}$$
