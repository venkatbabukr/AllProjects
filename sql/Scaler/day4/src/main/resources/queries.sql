-- Question: Q7
-- Problem Statement:

-- In the context of managing data for an Olympic event, you are tasked with sorting a table of countries based on their medal counts.
-- The goal is to determine the ranking of countries by their performance in the Olympics, prioritizing gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.

-- Write an SQL query that sorts the olympic table according to the following rules:

-- The country with more gold medals should come first.
-- If there is a tie in the no. of gold medals, the country with more silver medals should come first.
-- If there is a tie in the no. of silver medals, the country with more bronze medals should come first.
-- If there is a tie in the no. of bronze medals as well, then the countries with the tie are sorted in ascending order lexicographically.
